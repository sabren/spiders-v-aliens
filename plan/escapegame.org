** story text
*** opening cutscene
- The dentists grabbed me outside Rushmore spaceport.
  They had me on their table. I should have been a dead man.

- Turns out Dentists don't much care for Arnaxian spider venum.
  Gut spiders. Sick. All this time I thought it was acid reflux.

- I crack a smile as the anesthesia finally takes control.
  The world goes dark.

*** room 1
 - When I come to, the Dentists are dead. Good riddance.
   I can see my ship outside. Now's my chance to escape!

 - Arnaxian gut spiders. They can't really hurt me.
   Looks like the dentists trapped them all in here.

 - The dentists blockaded the hallway.
   I'll have to pull these boxes out of the way.

*** room 2
 - Uh oh. Another dentist, and he doesn't look happy.
   I'd better take some protection.

 - This portal is turned off.
   I think it's locked from the other side.

*** room 3
- That heart shaped thing is a medical device.
  I probably ought to pick it up.

*** room 4
 - What the heck?  They didn't teach that at Harvard!
   What are these guys doing with a mimeogeist?

 - Looks like the cage is powered by that box to the right.
   I should let the poor thing out.
   
*** room 5
 - A laser cannon! Now we're talking.
   I can grab it from any side to fire away from me.

*** room 5
- I can't reach the cannon from here.
  But that mimeogeist could do it!

*** room 5
